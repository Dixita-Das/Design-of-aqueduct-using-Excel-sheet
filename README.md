# Design-of-aqueduct-using-Excel-sheet

In this project, we have prepared the Design of an Aqueduct by adopting a new approach using Microsoft Excel. 

It can benefit people in different ways. 
* People can change the design data according to the requirements of different sites and the design parameters get calculated easily. 
* It is also a time saving approach since we don't have to calculate every design parameter manually which is quite a tedious work. 

In this project, we have used the data of Noanadi Irrigation Scheme, Mangaldoi, Assam collected from the Irrigation Department.
